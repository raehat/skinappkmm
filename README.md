# TWACHA

Twacha is a mobile app available on both Android and iOS platforms, designed for the early detection of skin cancers. Imagine you've just returned from a vacation spent on the beaches, and a few weeks later, you notice a peculiar dark spot on your skin that wasn't there before.

In most cases, it might be something harmless, but there's a less probable chance that it could be a form of skin cancer. Twacha can assist in the early detection of skin cancers, providing you with valuable information to help you decide if consulting a doctor is necessary. While consulting a doctor is always the first step, Twacha can help you make sure whether the skin lesion is indeed a potential concern, allowing you to schedule that doctor's appointment you might have postponed due to a busy schedule.
